# Phyloage

Phyloage is an experimental program to calculate time
estimates (TMRCA, Time To Most Recent Common Ancestor)
from SNP based phylogenetic trees.

It uses STR mutation counts for each node of the phylogenetic
tree and thus tries to circumvent the traditional shortcomings
of STR counting, which is often heavily influenced by younger
family branches.
